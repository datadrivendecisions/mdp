    "## Homework Assigmment 1.6 p.11 from Lecture notes\n",
    "\n",
    "An airline seeks a reservation policy for a flight with $S$ seats that maximizes its expected profit from the flight. Reservation requests arrive hourly according to a Bernoulli process with $p$ being the probability of a reservation request per hour (at most one reservation request will arrive per hour). A passenger with a booked reservation pays the fare $f > 0$ at flight time. If $b \\geq 0$ passengers with booked reservations are denied boarding at flight time, they do not pay the fare, and the airline pays them a penalty $c(b)$ (divided among them) where $b \\mapsto c(b)$ is increasing with $c(0) = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the $n$-th hour before flight time $T$. At the beginning of the hour, the airline reviews the number of booked reservations on hand, $r$ say, and decides whether to book (accept) or decline a reservation request arriving during the next hour. Each of the $r$ booked reservations may cancel during the hour, independently of each other, with probability $q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, the airline is considering the possibility of overbooking the flight to compensate for cancellations. Let $V^*_n(r)$ be the maximum expected future profit when there are $r$ booked reservations at the beginning of the hour, before the accept/decline decision has been taken, and reservation requests and cancellations during the hour have occurred. Let $W^*_n(r)$ be the maximum expected future profit when there are $r$ booked reservations after booking or declining a reservation request, but before cancellations. The aim is to determine an optimal reservation policy for any value of the number of booked reservations at the beginning of each hour till the flight time $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### a) Markov Decision Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulate the problem as a Markov decision model, by determining the state space, action spaces, rewards, terminal rewards, and the transition probabilities. Formulate the optimality equation from which an optimal reservation policy can be determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) Optimality of Booking-Limit Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume, as can be shown, that if $g$ is a quasiconcave function on the integers, then $r \\mapsto \\mathbb{E}(g(B_r))$ is quasiconcave, where $B_r$ is a sum of independent identically distributed Bernoulli random variables. We recall that $g$ is quasiconcave on the (positive) integers when there exists a number $a$ such that $g$ is increasing on $[0, a]$ and decreasing on $[a, \\infty]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this result to show the following facts. First, show that $r \\mapsto W^*_n(r)$ is quasiconcave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $b_n = \\arg\\max_r W^*_n(r)$. Call $b_n$ the booking limit. Then show that $r \\mapsto V^*_n(r)$ is quasiconcave with maximum $b_n$. Finally, show that it is optimal to accept a reservation if and only if $r < b_n$, with $r$ the number of booked reservations on hand at the beginning of the hour (before a decision has been taken).\n",
    "\n",
    "### c) Solving the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Solve the problem when the parameters are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   $T = 30$\n",
    "-   $c(b) = f \\cdot b$\n",
    "-   $S = 10$\n",
    "-   $f =$ € $300$\n",
    "-   $p = 0.2$ and $0.3$\n",
    "-   $q = 0.05$ and $0.10$\n",
    "-   $r \\leq 20$ (so there is an upper bound on the total number of reservations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Make graphs of the different combinations. In each case, estimate the booking limit ten hours before flight time from your graphs. Discuss whether your graphs confirm the claim in (b) that $r \\mapsto V^*_n(r)$ is quasiconcave.\n",
    "\n",
    "What conjectures do the graphs suggest about the optimal reservation policy and/or maximum expected reward and their variation with the various data elements? You will lose points on your conjectures only if your graphs are inconsistent with or do not support your conjectures, or if you don’t make enough interesting conjectures. The idea here is to brainstorm intelligently.\n",

    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `solve_mdp` function solves a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) to determine an optimal reservation policy for an airline. The goal is to maximize the airline's expected profit from a flight with a limited number of seats by making hourly decisions on whether to accept or reject incoming reservation requests. The function accounts for overbooking due to potential cancellations and applies penalties for denied boarding.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Recursive Value Calculation**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each time step `n > 0`, the function calculates the value of accepting (`V_{\\text{accept}}`) or rejecting (`V_{\\text{reject}}`) a reservation request. This is done using the `Value_calc` function, which computes the expected profit, taking cancellations into account. The value of accepting a reservation is: $$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overbooking and Penalties**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the number of reservations exceeds the capacity (`r > S`), the function applies a penalty `c(b)` where `b = r - S` represents the number of overbooked passengers. The profit is adjusted to account for this penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy Decision**\n",
    "\n",
    "At each time step and reservation level: - If `r >= r_max`, the policy is automatically set to `\"reject\"` (to prevent excessive overbooking). - Otherwise, the policy compares the expected value of accepting vs. rejecting the reservation and selects the action that maximizes the expected profit: $$\n",

    "This chart shows the optimal values and policies for different combinations of $p$ and $q$ ten hours before the flight. The solid lines represent the optimal policy of accepting reservations, while the dotted lines represent the optimal policy of rejecting reservations. The gap in the lines indicates the level of $r$ where the policy switches from 'accept' to 'reject' The color coding indicates different combinations of $p$ and $q$.\n",

    "#### Conjectures\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conjecture 1** - The booking limit $b_n$ depends only on $q$ and not on $p$ and increases with $q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the blue and green or red and purple lines ($p$ varies, $q$ is fixed) it is clear that the booking limit $b_n$ is independent of $p$. While comparing the blue and red lines or green and purple ($p$ is fixed, $q$ varies) it is clear that the booking limit $b_n$ increases with $q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conjecture 2** - The optimal value $V^*_n(r)$ decreases with $q$ and increases with $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the blue and red or green and purple lines ($q$ varies, $p$ is fixed) it is clear that the optimal value $V^*_n(r)$ decreases with $q$.
