    "Consider a discrete-time single-server queueing system that is observed every $\\eta > 0$ units of time. The controller makes decisions at times $0, \\eta, 2\\eta, \\dots$. Jobs arrive following a Poisson distribution with rate 1.5 jobs per period of length $\\eta$. There is a finite system capacity of eight units; that is, if arriving jobs cause the system content to exceed eight units, excess jobs do not enter the system and are lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each decision epoch, the controller observes the number of jobs in the system and selects the service rate from a set of probability distributions indexed by elements of the set $B = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. For each $b \\in B$, let $f_b(n)$ denote the probability of $n$ service completions within a period of length $\\eta$ with:\n",
